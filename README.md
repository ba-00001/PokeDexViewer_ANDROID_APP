-  During the creation of this app, I gained a better understanding of integrating third-party libraries like Glide and Retrofit to handle image loading and network requests effectively.
-  Implementing a RecyclerView with custom adapter allowed for the smooth display of a list of items, enhancing the overall user experience.
-  Experimenting with different themes and styles in the app's design improved my understanding of how to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
-  Incorporating the use of different drawables for dark mode enhanced the app's adaptability to different device settings, ensuring a consistent user experience across various viewing conditions.
-  Overall, the development process helped solidify my knowledge of Android app development and reinforced the importance of efficient data handling and user interface design. It was a valuable learning experience that will undoubtedly contribute to my future projects and endeavors in the field of app development.
